      span ðŸ’Ž webgems ?
    p Webgems is a goto place for devs and designers to find new resources and more. As a beginner it's sometimes not easy to find what you need since you don't know what you should look for.
    p Therefore i created this project to have the most common and best resources for beginners and veterans in one place. Kinda like a bookmarks list for devs and designers, containing only the best gems out there.
    p If you want to add your own gem, go ahead and open a pull request on github (click on that octocat at the top right corner).&nbsp;
    p By the way, this project lives by getting shared, if you find this worthy please share it with others.
    p made with love by&nbsp;
